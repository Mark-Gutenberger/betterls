# Yet Another Ls Command :sparkles:

(no attempt at a cheesy abbreviation)

#### A platform Independent, configurable port of ls

Inspired heavily by [@athityakumar's](https://github.com/athityakumar/) [ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) version of [colorls](https://github.com/athityakumar/colorls/). While the interface and functionality of the the application is remarkable, there are some notable drawbacks provided by ruby, and some others simply by the difficulty of cross-platform development.
Primary goals of this project are the following:

- performance above all else :watch:
  
  > Time is money, and as a developer milliseconds add to seconds add to minutes. Your time is valuable, use tools that respect that.

- complete platform independence :computer:
  
  > We've all been there. Found a great app, either downloaded a binary or tried to compile it just to learn it's incompatible with your platform. 

- user configurability :wrench:
  
  > You shouldn't need to have experience in low level programming to configure what your command line looks like. Configuration should be accessible to everyone.
