Create a library called "Hello" which includes the source file "hello.cxx".
# The extension is already found. Any number of sources could be listed here.
add_library (Hello hello.cxx)

# Make sure the compiler can find include files for our Hello library
# when other libraries or executables link to Hello
target_include_directories (Hello PUBLIC ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR})
# "demo.cxx" and "demo_b.cxx". The extensions are automatically found.
add_executable (helloDemo demo.cxx demo_b.cxx)

# Link the executable to the Hello library. Since the Hello library has
# public include directories we will use those link directories when building
# helloDemo
target_link_libraries (helloDemo LINK_PUBLIC Hello)
